### 1. 3-Statement Financial Model

This project showcases a dynamic and fully integrated 5-year, 3-statement financial model built from the ground up. The model begins with historical data and a set of core assumptions to drive a detailed forecast of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of business drivers and financial reporting.

#### Scenario & Key Assumptions

To provide a realistic context for the model, it's based on a scenario for a hypothetical high-growth service company planning for significant expansion. The core assumptions driving the 5-year forecast (2025-2029) are outlined below:

- **üìà Revenue Growth & Drivers:** Modeled a strong `+20%` annual revenue increase, reflecting a significant pipeline of new clients. Other asset accounts, such as "Other Current Assets," were assumed to grow in line with this top-line expansion.
- **üíº Operating Expense Structure:**
  - **Cost of Goods Sold** was modeled as a variable expense, directly tied to sales revenue.
  - **Salaries & Wages** were projected to grow by `+15%` annually to account for the necessary headcount increase to service a larger client base.
  - **Supporting Growth Costs** like Professional Fees (`+20%`) and Advertising (`+10%`) were forecast to grow steadily to support operational scale and build brand recognition.
- **üèóÔ∏è Capital & Financing Assumptions:**
  - The forecast isolates the company's organic operational performance by assuming **no new Capital Expenditures** and **no additional Equity Injections** over the period.
  - **Depreciation and Amortization** are calculated based on the existing Capital Expenditure schedule, flowing directly from the starting Balance Sheet.

This framework of assumptions creates an integrated and logical foundation for the entire 3-statement model.

Key activities in this analysis included:

- üìä **Income Statement Forecasting:** Projected revenue and expense line items using a combination of explicit growth assumptions and historical trend analysis. This included constructing a detailed, bottom-up depreciation schedule from a capital expenditure log using advanced Excel formulas (`SUMIFS`, `EOMONTH`).

- üîó **Balance Sheet Integration:** Forecasted asset and liability accounts by linking them to key drivers from the Income Statement, such as `Total Revenue Growth Rate` and `Total Expense Growth Rate`.

  - Working capital accounts (e.g., Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable) were projected based on their relationship to revenue and expenses.
  - The Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) balance was rolled forward by subtracting the calculated depreciation expense each year.

- üåä **Cash Flow Statement Construction:** Built the Cash Flow Statement from scratch using the indirect method.

  - Started with Net Income and added back non-cash charges like Depreciation.
  - Calculated the cash impact from Changes in Working Capital by analyzing the year-over-year changes in the forecasted Balance Sheet accounts.

- ‚öñÔ∏è **Balancing the Model:** Completed the final loop of the model by linking the `Ending Cash Balance` from the Cash Flow Statement back to the Cash account on the Balance Sheet. A balancing check was created and used to ensure `Total Assets = Total Liabilities & Equity`, which successfully validated the model's integrity and helped identify a formula error for correction.

- **Skills:** Financial Forecasting, 3-Statement Integration, Assumption-Driven Modeling, Working Capital Analysis, Depreciation & CapEx Scheduling, Cash Flow Reconciliation, Model Auditing & Balancing, Advanced Excel Formulas.

### 2. Event Profitability and Revenue Forecast

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a081d4f5-90fc-4a31-829d-f5fa479f2989)

This project involves building a driver-based revenue forecast from scratch to assess the profitability of a proposed event. Starting with historical sales data and a list of fixed costs, the analysis projects ticket and concession revenue to build a pro-forma Profit & Loss statement, culminating in a clear "go/no-go" recommendation based on the projected net margin.

#### Scenario & Key Activities

The model is built for a hypothetical scenario: an event committee needs to determine if their planned 2024 festival will be profitable.

- **Driver Identification & Analysis:** Analyzed historical data to identify key business drivers, such as the student participation rate and annual growth in ticket prices.
- **Attendance & Ticket Revenue Forecasting:** Forecasted the number of event attendees by applying an average historical participation rate to the total student population. Projected ticket price based on a consistent historical growth rate to determine total ticket revenue.
- **Concession Revenue Forecasting:** Modeled concession sales volume for various items as a percentage of total event attendees. Forecasted sales price and cost per unit based on historical trends to calculate total concession revenue and cost of goods sold.
- **P&L Construction & Profitability Analysis:** Consolidated the revenue forecasts and fixed operating expenses into a simple P&L statement. Calculated Gross Profit, Net Profit, and Net Margin to provide a clear view of the event's viability.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Driver-Based Forecasting, Profitability Analysis, P&L Construction, Trend Analysis, Assumption Documentation, Data-driven Decision Making, Excel (`AVERAGE`, `SUMPRODUCT`).

- **[‚û°Ô∏è View the Base Data (Before).xlsx](./Revenue_Forecasting/Event_Forecast_Base.xlsx)** - The historical data and list of fixed costs.

### 3. Budget vs. Actual (BvA) Variance Analysis üöß

This project demonstrates the critical FP&A function of variance analysis. The model compares monthly actual results to the annual budget, breaking down revenue and cost variances to provide actionable insights into business performance. The goal is to move beyond what happened to explain why it happened.

- **Skills:** Data consolidation, variance calculation (price, volume, mix), commentary preparation, performance reporting.
- **Status:** üöß Coming Soon

### 4. Rolling Forecast Model üöß

This model demonstrates the creation of a rolling forecast, which continuously updates the financial outlook as new actual data becomes available.

- **Skills:** Forecasting methodologies, scenario planning, updating models with actuals, timeline management.
- **Status:** üöß Coming Soon

### 5. Headcount and Payroll Planning üöß

This project involves building a detailed model to forecast payroll expenses, one of the largest operational costs for many companies.

- **Skills:** Bottom-up forecasting, headcount reconciliation, modeling salaries, bonuses, and benefits.
- **Status:** üöß Coming Soon

### 6. FP&A KPI Dashboard üöß

This Excel dashboard provides a high-level overview of the company's financial health by tracking key performance indicators (KPIs).

- **Skills:** Data visualization, dashboard design, pivot tables, charts, linking to source data.
- **Status:** üöß Coming Soon

### 7. SaaS Metrics and Cohort Analysis üöß

This model is specific to SaaS businesses and demonstrates an understanding of key industry metrics and cohort-based analysis.

- **Skills:** Calculating ARR/MRR, Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), churn analysis.

- **Git & GitHub:** Version control and portfolio hosting.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

I plan to continue expanding this portfolio with additional analyses, including:

* **Advanced Modeling:** Incorporate scenario and sensitivity analysis into existing models to show how changes in key assumptions impact financial outcomes.
* **Automation & BI:** Re-architect a model to pull historical data directly from a SQL database using Power Query, creating an automated, end-to-end data pipeline.
* **Valuation Analysis:** Add a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation module to the 3-Statement Model to determine the company's intrinsic value.
* **BI Dashboard Replication:** Replicate one of the Excel dashboards in a dedicated BI tool like Power BI or Tableau to showcase advanced data visualization skills.
